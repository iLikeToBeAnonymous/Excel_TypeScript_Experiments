# Excel_TypeScript_Experiments
A collection of scripts used while experimenting with Excel Online (via Office 365 for Business). Some of these are intended to be leveraged by PowerAutomate online flows.

# Miscellaneous Notes
- Office Scripts seem to (be default) live in OneDrive online at `My Files > Documents > Office Scripts` and/or locally at `C:\Users\<UserName>\OneDrive - <TenantName>\Documents\Office Scripts`
- While Office Scripts ARE TypeScript, they have the extension `.osts` instead of `.ts`
